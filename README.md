# Cosmos Hub Launch

This is the Interchain Foundation's recommendation for the Genesis Block Release
Software and marks the initiation of [phase
one](https://blog.cosmos.network/the-3-phases-of-the-cosmos-hub-mainnet-fdff3a68c4c0) of the Cosmos Hub launch.

The recommended genesis file is [this genesis.json](genesis.json).
Please read [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md) for details on how it was generated and
to recompute it for yourself.

The recommended software version is [v0.33.0 of the
Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.33.0).

Please note that this is *highly* experimental software. In these early days, we can
expect to have issues, updates, and bugs. The existing tools require advanced
technical skills and involve risks which are outside of the control of the
Interchain Foundation and/or the Tendermint team (see also the risk section in
the Interchain Cosmos Contribution Terms). Any use of this open source Apache
2.0 licensed software is done at your *own risk and on a “AS IS” basis, without
warranties or conditions of any kind*, and any and all liability of the
Interchain Foundation and/or the Tendermint team for damages arising in
connection to the software is excluded. **Please exercise extreme caution!**

Furthermore, it must be noted that it remains in the community's discretion to adopt or not
to adopt the recommended Genesis Block Release Software.
Therefore, ICF *cannot* guarantee that (i) ATOMs will be created and
(ii) the recommended allocation as set forth herein will actually take place.
