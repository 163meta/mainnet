# Cosmos Hub Launch

This is the Interchain Foundation's recommendation for the Genesis Block Release
Software and marks the initiation of [phase
one](https://blog.cosmos.network/the-3-phases-of-the-cosmos-hub-mainnet-fdff3a68c4c0) of the Cosmos Hub launch.

The recommended genesis file is [this genesis.json](genesis.json).
It includes a genesis time of `2019-03-13 23:00:00 UTC`.
Please read [GENESIS.md](GENESIS.md) for details on how it was generated and
to recompute it for yourself.

The recommended software version is [v0.33.0 of the
Cosmos-SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/releases/tag/v0.33.0).
See the [installation
instructions](https://cosmos.network/docs/gaia/installation.html)
and the [guide to joining mainnet](https://cosmos.network/docs/gaia/join-mainnet.html).

Users wishing to interact with the network should carefully review the security
advisories in the recent blog post on 
[preparing for main net
launch](https://blog.cosmos.network/cosmos-hub-to-launch-mainnet-a453d2247a34).

Please note that this is *highly* experimental software. In these early days, we can
expect to have issues, updates, and bugs. The existing tools require advanced
technical skills and involve risks which are outside of the control of the
Interchain Foundation and/or the Tendermint team (see also the risk section in
the Interchain Cosmos Contribution Terms). Any use of this open source Apache
2.0 licensed software is done at your *own risk and on a “AS IS” basis, without
warranties or conditions of any kind*, and any and all liability of the
Interchain Foundation and/or the Tendermint team for damages arising in
connection to the software is excluded. **Please exercise extreme caution!**

Furthermore, please note that it remains in the community's sole discretion to adopt or not
to adopt the recommended Genesis Block Release Software.
Therefore, Interchain Foundation *cannot* guarantee that (i) ATOMs will be created and
(ii) the recommended allocation as set forth herein will actually take place.
