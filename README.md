# Terra Core & Columbus Launch
![banner](launch-banner.png)

This repository contains the configuration parameters for the Columbus Network Genesis. Columbus is the first decentralized network of nodes communicating over [Terra Core](https://github.com/terra-project/core). 

The Columbus mainnet will go live on **April 23rd, 23:00 PST**. 

## Important Notes for Validators

1. **For genesis Validators**: Please follow [these instructions](INSTRUCTIONS.md) to prepare for genesis, claim rewards from the drill, and get ready for genesis. The recommended genesis file is currently being constructed. Please use [the genesis template](./params/genesis_template.json) to create your gentx. 

2. **To stay updated for the genesis**: Please monitor the private validator chat on Discord in real time to stay coordinated with Terraform Labs and the rest of the community regarding the launch. 


## Backgrounder on the Genesis

Terra is a project that is made possible thanks to the collective effort of its global community. Those of you interested in finding out the background of its genesis (esp. token allocations), please see [here](./GENESIS.md) and our [blog](https://medium.com/terra-money). Final parameter settings for Columbus can be found [here](./params.README.md).
